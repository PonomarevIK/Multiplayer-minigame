## Online minigame where you can shoot lasers to attack and draw walls to defend
This project is **not** really about game development since gameplay-wise its very mediocre. I've started it to refresh my memory on certain programming aspects including:
- Beautiful mathermatic solutions to gamedev problems
- Sending data between computers using sockets
- Client/Server communication
- Concurrent execution in multiple threads
